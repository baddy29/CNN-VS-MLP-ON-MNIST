# CNN-VS-MLP-ON-MNIST

This project implements neural networks using two different architectures â€“ linear neural network and convolution neural network. It aims to optimize the neural network to predict MNIST digit dataset. Few models were created, and accuracy of the predicted output were tabulated in terms of various accuracy criterion. It was observed that convolutional neural net performs better in predicting the digit image with stochastic gradient descent used as an optimizer. Increasing the number of input neurons to multi-layer perceptron in the convolutional neural network increases the accuracy of the model but it also slows down the training time by 4 times.
